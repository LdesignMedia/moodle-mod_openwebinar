Description
====================
MoodleFreak Openwebinar provides the function of live streaming and chatting in Moodle. You are able to schedule a meeting and give a live openwebinar. There is one public chat room. Most preference of the features can be generally set in settings. Settings can be overridden on instance level to be more customizable.

Installation
====================
1.  copy this plugin to the `mod\openwebinar` folder on the server
2.  login as administrator
3.  go to Site Administrator > Notification
4.  install the plugin
5.  you will need to fill out the settings. Please keep in mind you have the options to use a hosted setup or setup all dependencies yourself.

Installation broadcaster
====================
The openwebinar itself is completely webbased. But to stream a openwebinar as broadcaster you will need some software to stream a RTMP stream. 

We’ve used open broadcaster for this which is also an open source project. The users manual for this plugin can be found here.

Installation dependencies
====================
The openwebinar won't run without a **Chat server**. The chat server is developed by **MoodleFreak** and can be found on [openwebinar_chatserver](https://github.com/MoodleFreak/openwebinar_chatserver)

For the openwebinar you will also need a **rtmp streaming server**. We’ve build this especially for [nginx-rtmp](https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module) because its free and open source. Chances are high that another RTMP server will also work. 

**Note: Keep in mind that streaming will use a lot of bandwidth** 

Installation - nginx-rtmp for `openwebinar`
